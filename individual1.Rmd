head(choco)
```
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
```
The ratings don't follow a normal curve. There are outliers that received a rating of between 4.5-5 and 1-1.5 but most of the values fall between 2 and 5.
```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```
The scatter plot with cocoa percentage on the x-axis and the rating on the y-axis shows there is not a correlation between the two variables.
